# Bulletin board contract and DApp

This example implements a simple one-item bulletin board.  It allows
users to post a single message at a time, and only the user who posted
the message can take it down and make the board vacant again.

The full description of the bulletin board scenario, as well as a
detailed discussion of the code, can be found in part 3 of the
Midnight developer tutorial.

The `bboard-tutorial` directory contains a version of the bulletin
board DApp with some parts missing.  The tutorial guides you through
the process of filling in the missing pieces.  If you are reading this
in the `bboard-tutorial` directory, **do not expect the code to
compile until after you have completed the tutorial**.

The `bboard` directory contains the solution to the problems posed in
the tutorial.  You can think of it as the answer key to the
`bboard-tutorial` example.  If you are reading this in the `bboard`
directory, then the code should compile without changes, but do not
look at it until after you make an effort to complete the exercises by
following the tutorial.
